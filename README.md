## Background

Uptime's purpose is to provide a light-weight application for monitoring all of your web applications and services.  Uptime was born from the need for monitoring applications living **behind the firewall**, **in the DMZ**, or generally anywhere else that [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com) can't reach.

## Prerequisites

Docker

## Installing

Start Uptime by calling the Docker Compose Up command.

`docker compose up`
